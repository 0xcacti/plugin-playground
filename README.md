# banner.nvim

Banner is a neovim plug in to help you quickly make obnoxious banner comments. 
Maybe you are unironically a fan of banner comments, maybe you want to quickly 
make some really ugly comments.  Whatever the reasoning, banner will help you out.

For real though, banner is just a fun project I built to learn how to build 
neovim pluggins.  I have no problem with banner comments. 


-- okay, so banner.nvim actually started as a way to learn neovim extension building
I am building stackmap.nvim, a sample plugin from [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries)
